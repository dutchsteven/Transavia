# Transavia Test Automation (Frontend)
This project is for testing the different frontend websites of Transavia.
It uses Reqnroll to record the tests, and then run them using Selenium.

## Runsettings
To decide which environment the tests are run on, we use the runsettings.
If you want to test on another environment, you can change the runsettings-file in the csproj-file

## Tags
For consistency over projects, we have implemented several tags. These will be used during the execution of the tests.
For more information, please check the [Library\Tags.md](Library\Tags.md).
